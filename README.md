### About this project
This project is still in its idea phase, but there is some kickstarting code for one game idea. This project is planned to be on Steam's [GreenLight](http://steamcommunity.com/greenlight) program to then sell on the [Steam store](http://store.steampowered.com/)! This would be excilent for distribution and a source of income into the club account, so this would be cool :)

Now as for the ideas:
